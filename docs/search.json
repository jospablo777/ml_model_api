Also, distributing them in a manner that doesn’t affect our productivity, for example, manually running a Jupyter Notebook or an R script every time someone needs insights, is awfully unproductive.\nAn idea that is not new, is to deliver the “answers” in an automated, from which the clients can self-serve each time they are in need. After we have a data product, for instance, a predictive model (machine learning if you are into buzzwords), we can make available its capabilities to our stakeholders via a micro service."

Here is where the idea of microservices comes into action. A microservice is an isolated piece of software that is in charge of a single task (service) and communicates through a well-defined API. You finish your model, pack it in a microservice, and make it available through an API.\nThis way, the model will always be available, and its consumption won’t block other tasks. Also, more products could be potentially developed with the API."

    "text": "But what is an API?\nAn API is an intermediary that enables you to interact with a service without requiring knowledge of how this service works. You just need to know precisely what you want, tell it to the API, and the API will serve you what you requested.\nLet’s say that after work, you get hungry, so you park your Capital Bikeshare™ bike out of your favorite Mexican restaurant1. You enter the restaurant and sit at a table. Instead of going directly to the kitchen to cook your own meal or asking the chef what you want, you need to place your order through the waiter or waitress. You kindly request your enchiladas, and after a while, they bring your meal to you.\n\n\n\nAllegory of a restaurant. The waiter/waitress is the API; the kitchen is the service (they are dedicated to cooking); you are the client\n\n\nNotice that you, as the client, are not required to know how to cook enchiladas. Also, you do not interact directly with the people who prepare the food. You get what you want through a waiter (the API).\nIn summary, an API is the piece of the system you interact with to get a result generated by a service. Producing this result might be complex, but you don’t care about that since you only have to deal with the API."

    "text": "Software engineering for data scientists\nAnother problem common to data scientists is that research, predictive modeling, and analytics are dirty processes. This is partly due to a lack of training in software engineering, which involves design, testing, and software maintenance.\nWe usually have many problems to solve, questions to answer, and limited time at work. This leaves little to no time to apply the best practices to develop our analysis and maintain our code, leaving a trail of technical debt with each delivery. Yet, since most of us write code, we are, in fact, software developers because we develop software. This should be a hard-to-miss hint that software engineering practices must be core in our profession, or at least not ignored.\nHere, we will implement some practices core of software engineering like:\n\nCI/CD: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub Actions.\nAutomated tests: unit, integration, and inference tests with pytest.\nContainerization: package the application with Docker for consistency across environments (i.e., it should work on every machine with a well-setup Docker). Dependency Management: For reproducibility, dependencies were specified in a requirements.txt file, and development was conducted in an isolated environment (venv).\nMicroservices architecture: The project is a self-contained microservice focused on a single responsibility: predicting bike rentals. It is independently deployable and communicates through HTTP.\n\nWe intend to review these concepts in a practical, applied way. This will give us more tools to design and produce more sustainable systems, which we can develop more efficiently through good practices without sacrificing smooth delivery to our clients."

We are hired to solve analytical problems with evidence (data) as our raw material to produce those solutions.\nYou probably won’t be surprised to learn this project started as a Jupyter Notebook, which I encourage you to check out here. We are using an open data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\nLet’s assume we are working for Capital Bikeshare, a company dedicated to providing a self-service bike rental service managed through a mobile app. For the company, it is crucial to predict the peaks of service usage so they can restock or make more available their products when they’re more needed. These products can be cloud computing resources during peak hours, bicycle units, human staff, etc. Also it can b convenient to predict the dates and hours of least use for maintenance tasks, like server updates or bike maintenance.\n\n\n\nCapital Bikeshare station outside of the Eastern Market Metro station. Author: Ben Schumin (2010). Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nWorking as a data scientist for a big tech transport company, you will have lots of data and computational resources. On this occasion, you were put in charge of finding a way to predict the days and hours they will have to replenish their stock and increase the server’s capacity, investing in more resources only when necessary (saving money). Also, knowing when to schedule the maintenance labor will be valuable as well.\nAfter finishing the data exploration, you know that working days and the entry and exit from work hours are the busiest time frames. Also, climatic conditions can affect the willingness to rent a bike. You are cautious, so you first took the time to understand the phenomenon. Then, you built the model prototype and corroborated that it is possible to forecast the number of rented bikes at an hour-of-the-day granularity level.\nSuccess! You have a model that can help determine the best time to provide more resources or the times for maintenance. Does this mean that you have already finished with the task and can go on to live the good life?2 Well, you already know that Jupyter is not a tool that produces clean results and that if you leave it there, your model will have to be run manually each time, which can introduce bugs and errors. This also means that you will have a high and constant influx of people knocking at your door3 asking for predictions and insights.\nJupyter is ideal for experimenting and testing but not for delivering results. Hence, you have decided to deploy this first iteration of the model (the prototype) as a microservice that can be consumed via an API. Here, you can assess how the model behaves in the wild and prepare for future iterations. You will start adding value with predictions and valuable information that will help improve your model.\nThe engineering team, for example, will quickly adopt the app to know when to conduct maintenance jobs."

    "section": "API development",
    "text": "API development\nThe API will move data around (receive and deliver) as its primary job, so it is key to establish a clear set of rules for the data our clients send. Moving back to our restaurant example, you probably could put your enchiladas order in English or Spanish, but it might be hard for the waiter if you place the order in Japanese7. Hence, to get your enchiladas, you must request them in a way that the staff can understand, and Pydantic is here to enforce the rules that make such understanding happen.\n\n\n\nAn ambiguous (and invalid) request request to the API, so no enchiladas :(\n\n\n\nDefining the Pydantic model\nWe will start this section by defining our Pydantic model. Pydantic is a library for data validation that uses Python-type annotations. Let’s establish a Pydantic model for our API requests and learn more about the library in the process.\nFilename: app/models/bike_sharing.py\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator\n\n1class BikeSharingRequest(BaseModel):\n2    season: str = Field(..., description=\"Season (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall)\")\n    mnth: str = Field(..., description=\"Month name (January, etc.)\")\n3    hr: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=23, description=\"Hour of the day\")\n    holiday: str = Field(..., description=\"Yes/No if holiday\")\n    weekday: str = Field(..., description=\"Name of the weekday (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday)\")\n4    workingday: str = Field(..., description=\"Yes/No if working day\")\n    weathersit: int = Field(..., description=\"Weather code\")\n    temp: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized temperature\")\n    atemp: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized feeling temperature\")\n    hum: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized humidity\")\n    windspeed: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized wind speed\")\n\n5    @field_validator(\"season\")\n6    def validate_season(cls, v):\n        allowed = {\"Winter\", \"Spring\", \"Summer\", \"Fall\"} \n7        if v not in allowed:\n8            raise ValueError(f\"season must be one of {allowed}\")\n        return v\n\n# -- snip -- (validators continue)\n\n\n1\n\nThe first thing to notice is that the Pydantic model is defined as a Python class that inherits from BaseModel; this is the Pydantic base class used to create models with built-in data validation.\n\n2\n\nEach class attribute is defined with a data type; season, for example, is defined as str. We also use the function Field() to specify constraints and metadata; the ellipsis literal ... here means two things: first, a value must be provided, second, there is no default value for this attribute. Then, some metadata is specified in the description parameter.\n\n3\n\nFor hr attribute, we have constraints used for numeric validation. So, ge=0 means that the hour has to be greater or equal to 0, while le=23 indicates that the hour should be less or equal to 23. So if the user send a request with hr=-1 the system will complain and throw a warning.\n\n4\n\nWith what we know so far, we could read this line as “workingday is a required str field with a description.”\n\n5\n\nWe have the field_validator decorator8 to build custom validation logic for a specific field. Besides the already fantastic default capabilities of Pydantic, we can define our custom validations. In this case, we want to be sure that the client will provide only valid values for the season field. CatBoost uses categories as predictors, and it is case sensitive (i.e., \"Summer\" != \"summer). With this extra step, FastAPI will send a custom message to the client, informing that the API expects \"Summer\" not \"summer\".\n\n6\n\nWe define the function validate_season, which takes two parameters: cls, a keyword indicating a reference to the class (BikeSharingRequest), and v, representing the value of the field we’re validating.\n\n7\n\nCheck if the value we validate is within the allowed set.\n\n8\n\nRaise an error if the value is not allowed; it also tells the client which values are expected.\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize the structure of our Pydantic model:\nFilename: app/models/bike_sharing.py\n\n1from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator\n\n2class BikeSharingRequest(BaseModel):\n3    season: str = Field(..., description=\"Season (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall)\")\n    mnth: str = Field(..., description=\"Month name (January, etc.)\")\n    hr: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=23, description=\"Hour of the day\")\n    holiday: str = Field(..., description=\"Yes/No if holiday\")\n    weekday: str = Field(..., description=\"Name of the weekday (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday)\")\n    workingday: str = Field(..., description=\"Yes/No if working day\")\n    weathersit: int = Field(..., description=\"Weather code\")\n    temp: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized temperature\")\n    atemp: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized feeling temperature\")\n    hum: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized humidity\")\n    windspeed: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1, description=\"Normalized wind speed\")\n\n4    @field_validator(\"season\")\n    def validate_season(cls, v):\n        allowed = {\"Winter\", \"Spring\", \"Summer\", \"Fall\"}\n        if v not in allowed:\n            raise ValueError(f\"season must be one of {allowed}\")\n        return v\n\n# -- snip -- (validators continue)\n\n\n1\n\nRequired Pydantic imports.\n\n2\n\nThe model is defined as a Python class.\n\n3\n\nWithin the class, we define the model’s fields as attributes of the class\n\n4\n\nWe can include custom validators within the model.\n\n\n\n\nGreat! Now, we have a Pydantic model and a better understanding of it. Next, we will work on our API.\n\n\nFastAPI development\nWith the data model in place (BikeSharingRequest), it’s time to develop the core of our FastAPI microservice. FastAPI makes it easy to build performant APIs with built-in data validation and clear, concise code. In this section, we’ll walk through setting up the app, creating endpoints, and serving a machine learning model for predictions.\nTo get started with our FastAPI app, we create the Python file app/main.py. Let’s take a look at the imports we’re gonna need.\nFilename: app/main.py\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom typing import List\nfrom app.services.ml_model import load_model\nfrom app.services.requests_to_polars import req_to_polars\n1from app.models.bike_sharing import BikeSharingRequest\nfrom fastapi import HTTPException\n\n# --snip--\n\n\n1\n\nIn this line we import the Pydantic data model we created in the previous step.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will begin coding the core of our FastAPI app, starting with the instantiation of the main application object, app. This is done using the FastAPI() constructor. The annotated code is shown below.\nFilename: app/main.py\n\n# -- snip --\n\n# Instantiate a FastAPI class, the core of the application\n1app = FastAPI()\n\n# Read predictive model\n2ml_model = load_model('predictive_models/catboost_model_19Dec2024.cbm')\n\n# Defines a GET endpoin at the root path \"/\"\n3@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def index() -&gt; dict:\n    return {\"message\": \"Bike rentals ML predictor (regressor)\"} # Returns a simple JSON response with a message\n\n# --snip--\n\n\n1\n\nInstantiates the main FastAPI application. Every endpoint and configuration will attach to this app object.\n\n2\n\nRead the predictive model, which is a trained CatBoost model.\n\n3\n\nA GET endpoint to the root URL. When someone accesses this endpoint, they will be served with the “message.”\n\n\n\n\nSo far, we have instantiated the FastAPI application and defined the root endpoint. Next, we’ll implement the core functionality of our app by defining the /predict endpoint. This endpoint serves as the heart of the API, handling four key responsibilities:\n\nValidation: Ensures the incoming requests meet the expected format and constraints.\nData Processing: Transforms input data into a format compatible with the trained CatBoost model.\nPrediction: Uses the model to generate predictions based on the input.\nResponse Generation: Packages the predictions into a JSON response to return to the client.\n\n\nDefining the /predict Endpoint\nIn this step, we define the core functionality of our API: the /predict endpoint. This endpoint handles incoming POST requests, validates the input data, processes it, generates predictions using the trained CatBoost model, and returns the predictions as a JSON response.\nLet’s see the code.\nFilename: app/main.py\n\n# -- snip --\n\n# Defines a POST endpoint for predictions\n1@app.post('/predict',\n          summary = \"Predict bike rentals\",\n          description = \"Takes input data and returns amount rental predictions (regression).\")\n2async def predict_rentals(requests: List[BikeSharingRequest]) -&gt; dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Predict bike rentals based on input features.\n\n    Args:\n        requests (List[BikeSharingRequests]): A list of input data objects.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the predictions as a list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Handles the case when an empty list is posted\n3    if not requests:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code = 422,\n            detail = \"The request is empty\"\n        )\n    \n    # Convert each pydantic model to a dict and load into a Polars DataFrame\n4    df = req_to_polars(requests)\n\n    # Instances to predict\n5    features = df.to_numpy()\n\n    # Make predictions\n6    predictions = ml_model.predict(features)\n\n    return {\n7        'predictions': predictions.tolist()\n    }\n\n\n1\n\nPOST Endpoint Definition: Defines a POST endpoint at /predict with metadata for better documentation (summary and description).\n\n2\n\nInput Validation: Expects a list of BikeSharingRequest objects, ensuring automatic data validation by FastAPI.\n\n3\n\nEmpty Request Handling: If the request body is empty ([]), returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with a descriptive message.\n\n4\n\nData Transformation: Converts the list of validated Pydantic objects into a Polars DataFrame for efficient processing.\n\n5\n\nCompatibility with CatBoost: Since CatBoost does not accept Polars DataFrames, the data is converted to a NumPy array.\n\n6\n\nPredictions: Uses the trained CatBoost model to compute predictions based on the input data.\n\n7\n\nResponse Creation: Returns the predictions as a JSON-compatible dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndpoint Responsibilities\nThe predict_rentals function handles multiple responsibilities:\n\nEdge Case Handling: Validates and handles empty input.\nData Transformation: Converts structured input data into a format compatible with the machine learning model (numpy).\nInference: Generates predictions using the trained CatBoost model.\nResponse Generation: Packages the results into a JSON response.\n\n\n\nTesting the Application\nWith the ‘/predict’ endpoint defined, we now have the core functionality of our prediction API. Let’s test it!\n\nClone the Repository\nIf you haven’t already, clone the GitHub repository to follow along.\n\n\nRun the Application\nFrom the root of the project, start the FastAPI app using Uvicorn:\n\nuvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000\n\nOnce the application is running, you should see output similar to this in your terminal:\n\nuser@user-pc:~/ml_model_api$ uvicorn app.main:app\nINFO:     Started server process [19168]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:     Application startup complete.\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\n\n\n\nExplore the API\nWith the app running, you can now access the API:\n\nAPI Root: http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n\nWhen you visit the root endpoint, you’ll see the following message:\n\n{\n  \"message\": \"Bike rentals ML predictor (regressor)\"\n}\n\n\n\n\nPydantic model\nOne of the standout features of FastAPI is its ability to automatically generate API documentation, complete with interactive functionality. You can access the API documentation for this project by visiting:\n\nSwagger UI (API Documentation): http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs\n\nIn this interface, you can:\n\nExplore the API’s endpoints and their specifications.\nTest the endpoints directly using the provided interface.\nExamine the Pydantic model used for data validation.\n\n\nExploring the Pydantic Model\nFastAPI uses Pydantic under the hood to validate and parse incoming JSON data. If you navigate to the Swagger UI, you’ll find the schema for the BikeSharingRequest model. This schema provides key information:\n\nField Descriptions: Attributes in the BikeSharingRequest class are documented, including the description parameter provided via Field().\nData Type Constraints: Default type constraints (e.g., string, integer) are visible for each field.\nRange Restrictions: For numeric fields, restrictions such as [0, 23] for the hr field are displayed clearly in square brackets.\n\n\n\nCustom Validators\nWhile custom validators are not automatically displayed in the Swagger UI, their logic is included (manually) as metadata in the description of the corresponding fields. For instance, you can view notes about specific constraints or requirements that are enforced programmatically.\nFastAPI ensures each JSON object in the incoming list is validated and parsed into a BikeSharingRequest instance using Pydantic. This guarantees data consistency and simplifies further processing.\n\n\n\nSwagger UI. The Pydantic model for BikeSharingRequest is expanded in the Schemas section\n\n\n\n\n\nFastAPI app\nThe FastAPI process begins when a user sends a POST request containing input data in JSON format. FastAPI inspects the request body and knows to parse it as a List[BikeSharingRequest] object. FastAPI knows how to parse the JSON due to the endpoint function signature:\nFilename: app/main.py\n\n@app.post('/predict', \n          summary = \"Predict bike rentals\", \n          description = \"Takes input data and returns amount rental predictions (regression).\")\n1async def predict_rentals(requests: List[BikeSharingRequest]) -&gt; dict:\n\n\n1\n\nIn the function signature, the List[BikeSharingRequest] annotation informs FastAPI to interpret the raw JSON input as a list of JSON objects that match the BikeSharingRequest schema.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Breakdown\n\n1. JSON Parsing and Validation\n\nFastAPI loops through the JSON objects in the request body.\nEach JSON object is validated against the BikeSharingRequest Pydantic model.\nValidation includes:\n\nEnsuring all required fields are present.\nVerifying field types and constraints.\nApplying custom validators defined in the BikeSharingRequest model.\n\n\n\n\n2. Error Handling\n\nIf any JSON object fails validation, FastAPI stops the process and returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity response, including details about the validation errors.\nThe predict_rentals function is not called if validation fails.\n\n\n\n3. Object Creation\n\nIf all JSON objects pass validation, FastAPI creates a list of BikeSharingRequest instances and passes them to the predict_rentals function as the requests argument.\n\n\n\n4. Data Shaping and Inference\n\nInside the predict_rentals function:\n\nThe input data is shaped for inference by the CatBoost model.\nFrom List(BikeSharingRequest) to numpy array.\nPredictions are generated using the trained model.\n\n\n\n\n5. Response\n\nThe predictions are formatted as a JSON response and sent back to the user.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Representation\nThe entire process is summarized in the flowchart below:\n\n\n\nVisual representation of our FastAPI app\n\n\nFor simplicity, the Uvicorn server is abstracted away from the diagram. The focus is solely on the core FastAPI application flow, from receiving a request to sending a response.\nWith the core functionality of our FastAPI application in place, (i.e., the `/predict/predict endpoint for serving predictions), it’s time to focus on deployment and automation. While building a robust application is essential, ensuring that it can be reliably tested, built, and deployed is equally important. This is where Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) come into play.\n\nBy implementing CI/CD pipelines, we can:\n\nAutomate Testing: Ensure every change to the codebase is verified by running unit tests and integration tests automatically.\nStreamline Deployment: Build and push a Docker image of the application to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub), ready for deployment in any environment.\nMaintain Code Quality: Catch bugs early and enforce consistent standards with every change.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll set up a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions to:\n\nRun automated tests with pytest.\nBuild and publish a Docker image of our FastAPI app.\nLet’s dive into automating the lifecycle of our application!"

This is where automated tests prove invaluable—they act as a safety net, quickly identifying errors and verifying that your changes didn’t break any existing functionality.\nIn this section, we’ll explore how automated tests are implemented in our project, focusing on key scenarios such as:\n\nValidating the functionality of the /predict endpoint.\nEnsuring data transformation processes work as expected.\nVerifying the behavior of the trained CatBoost model.\n\nLet’s dive into writing and running automated tests to ensure and enhance the quality of our FastAPI application! All test scripts are organized in the tests/ directory, categorized into three logical groups:\n\nAPI tests: Validate the endpoints of our FastAPI app.\nInference tests: Ensure the ML model behaves as expected during predictions.\nUnit tests: Test isolated components, such as helper functions or data transformations.\n\n\nAPI tests\nWhile we won’t cover every example, feel free to explore the full test suite in the repository. For now, let’s focus on a test for the API.\nBelow is an example test for the /predict endpoint, which validates predictions for a single input row:\nFilename: tests/test_api.py\n\n# --snip--\n\n# Test the /predict endpoint with a single row\ndef test_predict_rentals_single():\n1    payload = {\n        \"season\": \"Summer\",\n        \"mnth\": \"June\",\n        \"hr\": 14,\n        \"holiday\": \"No\",\n        \"weekday\": \"Monday\",\n        \"workingday\": \"Yes\",\n        \"weathersit\": 1,\n        \"temp\": 0.78,\n        \"atemp\": 0.697,\n        \"hum\": 0.43,\n        \"windspeed\": 0.2537\n    }\n    response = client.post(\"/predict\", json=[payload])  \n2    assert response.status_code == 200\n    assert \"predictions\" in response.json()\n    assert isinstance(response.json()[\"predictions\"], list)\n\n# --snip--\n\n\n1\n\nSimulates a Request Sends a single payload to the /predict endpoint, mimicking a real-world API request.\n\n2\n\nValidates the Response\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures the API returns a 200 OK status, confirming successful processing.\nVerifies that the response contains a predictions key.\nChecks that the predictions are returned as a list, as expected.\n\nThis test is important for ensuring the /predict endpoint handles individual requests correctly. By automating it, we safeguard against regressions whenever the API logic or underlying model is updated.\nLet’s now move forward to explore other tests or dive deeper into how the inference logic is validated.\n\n\nInference tests\nInference tests are designed to verify that the predictive model is functioning correctly in terms of processing inputs and generating outputs. While these tests don’t evaluate whether the model’s predictions are accurate (a more complex task we will leave for the company data scientists9), they ensure that the model receives the expected input features and produces predictions in the correct format.\nThe following is an example inference test:\nFile: tests/test_inference.py\n\n# --snip--\n\n# Test model prediction with a single row\ndef test_model_single_prediction():\n    features = np.array([[\"Summer\", \"June\", 14, \"No\", \"Monday\", \"Yes\", 1, 0.78, 0.697, 0.43, 0.2537]])\n    prediction = ml_model.predict(features)\n    assert prediction is not None\n    assert isinstance(prediction, np.ndarray)\n\n# --snip--\n\n\nInput Simulation\n\nCreates a NumPy array representing a single row of input features for the predictive model.\nMimics real-world input data to ensure the test is practical and relevant.\n\nOutput Validation\n\nConfirms that the model returns a valid prediction (i.e., not None or empty).\nVerifies that the output is a NumPy array, as expected from the CatBoost model.\n\n\nInference tests are essential for detecting issues such as:\n\nInput Format Errors: Ensuring the model can process the provided features without errors.\nOutput Integrity: Verifying that predictions are returned in the correct data structure (e.g., NumPy array).\nModel Loading: Checking that the model is correctly loaded and operational.\n\n\n\nRunning the tests\nRunning these tests with pytest is a breeze. You just need to go to the root of the project (in a terminal) and run pytest folder_that_contain_the_tests/. So, let’s run the tests:\n\npytest tests/\n\nIf everything goes well, we will see an output like this output in our terminal:\n\nuser@user-pc:~/ml_model_api$ pytest tests/\n======================================== test session starts =========================================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.3, pytest-8.3.4, pluggy-1.5.0\nrootdir: ~/ml_model_api\nplugins: anyio-4.7.0, cov-6.0.0\ncollected 12 items                                                                                   \n\ntests/test_api.py .....

With this strong foundation, we can now move on to deploying and running the microservice."

    "text": "CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuos Deployment)\nContinuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential pillars of modern software development, enabling teams to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. They ensure that every change to the codebase is rigorously tested and deployed efficiently.\nWhile I’d love to provide an in-depth introduction to CI/CD here, I highly recommend the excellent tutorial by Itskmyoo, titled Automating FastAPI Project Build with GitHub Actions and Push to DockerHub. It offers a clear, practical guide to setting up CI/CD pipelines for FastAPI projects using GitHub Actions.\n\nOur Customization\nBuilding on Itskmyoo’s tutorial, we’ll implement a similar CI/CD pipeline with minor adjustments tailored to our project. Below are the configurations you’ll need to get started.\n\nDockerfile (Containerization)\nThe Dockerfile is critical for containerizing our FastAPI app. Here’s the updated version for our project:\nFilename: Dockerfile\n\n# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\nFROM python:3.12-slim\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /api_app\n\n# Copy the requirements file into the container\nCOPY requirements.txt /api_app/\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the project files into the container\nCOPY . /api_app/\n\n# Expose port 80 for external access\nEXPOSE 80\n\n# Define environment variable\nENV NAME=ml-model-api-docker\n\n# Set the maintainer label\nLABEL maintainer=\"jospablo777 &lt;jospablo777@gmail.com&gt;\" # Modify this as needed\n\n# Run the FastAPI app with Uvicorn\nCMD [\"uvicorn\", \"app.main:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"80\"]\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions Workflow\nThe GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml) automates testing, building, and pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub. Below is the configuration for our project:\n\nname: ML Model API - Test, build, and push\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n      with:\n        python-version: \"3.12\"\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n    - name: Run tests\n      run: pytest tests/ --cov=app\n\n  build:\n    needs: test # build job runs only if tests pass\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up Docker Buildx\n      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1\n\n    - name: Login to Docker Hub\n      run: echo ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} --password-stdin\n\n    - name: Build and push Docker image\n      run: |\n        docker buildx create --use\n        docker buildx build \\\n          --file Dockerfile \\\n          --tag jospablo777/ml-model-api:latest \\\n          --push .\n\n    env:\n      DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL: enabled\n      DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1\n\nThe main modification was adding a testing section before the docker build.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTesting:\n\nRuns on every push to the main branch.\nInstalls dependencies and runs pytest to verify the codebase, ensuring that only tested and reliable code proceeds to the build stage.\n\nBuilding:\n\nAfter passing the tests, the build job creates a Docker image using the specified Dockerfile.\nThe image is tagged and pushed to Docker Hub.\n\nEnvironment Variables:\n\nThe pipeline uses DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN and DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, securely stored in GitHub Secrets, to authenticate with Docker Hub.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Steps\nWith the guidance from Itskmyoo’s tutorial and the customizations above, our CI/CD pipeline is ready to go. Every push to the main branch will:\n\nRun automated tests.\nBuild a Docker image.\nPush the image to Docker Hub for seamless deployment.\n\nThis process is illustrated here:\n\n\n\nCI/CD configuration for our project\n\n\nThis setup ensures your application is always deployable and meets high-quality standards."
